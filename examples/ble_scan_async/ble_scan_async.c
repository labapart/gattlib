 * Look 'ma, no threads!

 * This is an async version of the ble_scan example, using relevant
 * async calls to scan/connect, and callbacks to implement the logic.
 *
 * The point of this sample is that threads could be used, 
 * for instance to drive the process_async() calls, but aren't 
 * required in order to get on with other business while the BLE 
 * stuff is happening in the background.
